# [ngBoilerplateShop](http://philtoms.github.com/ng-boilerplate-shop) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/philtoms/ng-boilerplate-shop.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/philtoms/ng-boilerplate-shop)

An opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) E-Commerce projects. 

`ngBoilerplateShop` is built on top of [ngBoilerplate](http://philtoms.github.com/ng-boilerplate-shop), a basic framework for kick starting AngularJS projects. 
This means it supports and encourages AngularJS best-practices from the ground up.

ngBoilerPlateShop ships with the following features and components:

- A shopping cart - of course
- pluggable gateways (Worldpay and Paypal are supplied)
- Comprehensive and instantaneous product search results
- Disqus commemtary and discussoin forum built in
- Social media 'like' buttons
- Google analytics

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/philtoms/ng-boilerplate-shop
$ cd ng-boilerplate-shop
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

To see the initial website out of the box, open `file:///path/to/ng-boilerplate-shop/build/index.html` in your browser.

Now start hacking into the code to turn it into your own E-Commerce shopping website. 

## Development Scenario 1

You want to use the basic layout of the shop as is, you just want to re-brand it and load up your own product range.
